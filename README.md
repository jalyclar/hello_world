GitHub Practice 
# My first and simple Git Repository 

This is my first attempt to create a Git repository on GitHub. The goal here is to learn how to create and maintain a repository. I am interested in:
- Creating a branch
- Working on the branch and comitting my changes.
- Merging the branch to 'main'
